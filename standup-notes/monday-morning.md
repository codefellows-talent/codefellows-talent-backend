# Monday Morning Standup

In attendance: full team + Brook Riggio representing product ownership & as mentor

Current Status:
Friday: we worked on design and project management concerns - wireframes, user stories
To do: set up work tracker (Trello board? GitHub issues + projects?) -- establish a work plan for today
First today: views -- start with single most useful view (Profiles)

Persistence -- do we need user accounts? It would probably be nice, but does product owner (Jeff Malek) want this?
  Brook: this could be a stretch goal maybe? Following "principle of least surprise", people would expect to be able to recover current state from devices
  however this is not core to the MVP

Don't be afraid to contact Jeff directly for guidance!

Questions:

* Michael -- we thought we'd model the style/feel after the CF calendar page. Should we put a hero image in? (Yes!)
* Michael -- there's kind of a lot of data - how much should be shown on profile preview list? We want to show as much relevant information, but we're concerned it's too busy.
  * Brook -- username, tagline, top 2 technology icons would be good.
* Saul -- question regarding viewing profiles on profile list vs. contact list
  * Nicu -- modal to view detailed profile should be a reusable component to be used in both places
  * Brook -- we can add icons etc. to break up the design, if needed
* Nicu -- repo?
  * Brook -- public repo, public org, MIT license. Add Brook as an owner of the org.

Brook - designate roles (PM, etc.); converse on how to solve conflicts
